        <h1>Hi! I'm Samruddhi.</h1>
        <p>I'm learning how to code a better world. I'm doing this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Researching</li>
                <li>Designing</li>
                <li>Developing</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>When I chose my Cognitive Science specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, I had no idea what I really signed up for.
        However, after taking core and elective courses, I was exposed to the world of data science and predictive analysis. Since discovering my passion for data, 
        I've completed both class and individual data science research projects.</p>

    <div class="design">
    <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Design has always been a hobby for a simple reason - I liked making things pretty. However, when I took my first design class, I learned that
            it's not always about just making things pretty - they have to be useful too. Throughout the design class, I learned various design concepts, as well as 
            helpful guidelines to conduct a design as well as redesign process using human-centered thinking.
        </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Researching and designing is great, but creating an actual product is where the fun lies! Here are some applications I've created in my free time.</p>
